### Introduction

```
The goal of this AE exercise is to familiarize yourselves with the design, implementation
and performance testing of C programming with the given medical dataset in the Internet
of Things (IoT) edge computing machine learning landscape. Given the problem statement
with the dataset, you will be required to go through the whole cycle of problem definition,
problem analysis, algorithm and pseudocode design. You will implement with testing and
demonstrate your classification/regression algorithm in C programming.
```

## Compiling
Do `make` to compile and `make clean` to clear files
